What IA is?

Internship Alerts is a MSME Registered Global community which works on comprehensive information about upcoming and latest internships and job updates.

We are on a mission to build global community with various startups and companies which will help students to build themselves.

An initiative taken by IA Team is Internship Alerts organizes a Virtual Internship Program i.e., IA VIP Program which help students to grow & explore their skills and utilise their spare time by doing internships. 

Many people are not getting the updates due to lack of opportunity, lack of resources, lack of awareness that what is going on in the corporate sector. To meet the need of such people we made Internship Alerts. 

                                                          "Build yourself in which you are passionate!"
